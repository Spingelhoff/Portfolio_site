    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/AboutPic.jpg"
    content: |-
      I am a cell and systems biologist, by training, that fell in love with
      data. The utility, scope and speed of analytical processes today were 
      dazzling which led to a career pivot to get closer to the action.
      
      I have always had a passion for learning and finding answers to novel 
      questions that has pushed me to continously improve my analytical 
      skills. I am proud to be self taught in the data tools I use 
      today which, I believe is a testament to my drive and adaptability.

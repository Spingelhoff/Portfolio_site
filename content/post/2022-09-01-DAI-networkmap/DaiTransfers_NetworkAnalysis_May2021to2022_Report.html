<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) use the blockchain to conduct
transparent corporate operations. One of the most successful DAOs to date is
MakerDAO. Their staying power in the tumultuous environment of crypto is largely
attributed to the wide adoption of their overcollateralized backed USD stable
coin, DAI.</p>
<p>All blockchain transactions are public and pseudonymous. This gives
unprecedented public transparency to the inner workings of blockchain based
businesses and their products. In this report, I extract all DAI specific
transfers of value and map influential addresses in an interactive
network using ggraph and visNetwork to investigate key actors in the DAI
ecosystem. I will outline my methodology and analyze the resultant networkmap.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Using the MakerDAO events table I created, I subset all DAI events. Values were
stored in BigQuery as hexadecimals because values were too large to store in
BigQuery.</p>
<pre class="sql"><code>CREATE TABLE 
  makerdao_operations.dai_events_may2021to2022
PARTITION BY DATE (
  block_timestamp
)
CLUSTER BY
  makerdao_smartcontract,
  makerdao_function
AS (
  SELECT
    block_timestamp,
    makerdao_smartcontract,
    makerdao_function,
    to_address AS transaction_sender,
    from_address AS transaction_reciever,
    sender AS event_sender,
    reciever AS event_reciever,
    eth_value,
    value,
    percision
  FROM `ethereum-explorer-354118.makerdao_operations.may2021to2022`
  WHERE makerdao_smartcontract IN (
    &#39;DAI&#39;,
    &#39;DAIJOIN&#39;,
    &#39;GEMJOIN&#39;,
    &#39;JUG&#39;,
    &#39;POT&#39;
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>The subset table was imported into R and converted into decimal form according
to the event specific degree of precision.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#clean data from extracted from google bigquery
data &lt;- as_tibble(
  read.csv(
    file = &#39;dai_events_may2021to2022.csv&#39;,
    header = TRUE,
    colClasses = c(&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;character&quot;, &quot;character&quot;, &quot;character&quot;,
                  &quot;character&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;, &quot;character&quot;))) %&gt;% 
  mutate(value =
    ifelse (percision == &#39;wad&#39;, value/10e18,
      ifelse (percision == &#39;ray&#39;, value/10e27,
        ifelse (percision == &#39;rad&#39;, value/10e45, NaN)))) %&gt;% 
  select(-percision)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, all transfer (of value) events pertaining to the DAI smartcontract
were extracted.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filter events to pull out only DAI transaction data
dai_transactions &lt;- data %&gt;% 
  filter(makerdao_smartcontract == &#39;DAI&#39; &amp; 
    makerdao_function == &#39;transfer&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Before mapping a network, data had to be transformed into a form readable by
network mapping packages. The node list was formed from unique senders and
receivers. The edge list was formed from all transactions between unique
addresses. Multiple transactions between the same addresses were counted as
‘weight’. Total transaction value was summed for each unique address pair.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#create node list (list of nodes with corresponding IDs)
node_list &lt;- dai_transactions %&gt;% 
  distinct(sender) %&gt;% 
  full_join(distinct(dai_transactions, reciever), 
    by = c(&quot;sender&quot; = &quot;reciever&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  rowid_to_column(&quot;id&quot;)

#check node list
node_list

#create edge list with count as weight and add value column
edge_list &lt;- dai_transactions %&gt;% 
  group_by(sender, reciever) %&gt;% 
  summarize(weight = n(), amount = sum(value)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup()

#convert edge list addresses into id specified in node_list
edge_list_byid &lt;- edge_list %&gt;%
  left_join(node_list, by = &quot;sender&quot;) %&gt;%
  rename(from = id) %&gt;%
  left_join(node_list, by = c(&quot;reciever&quot; = &quot;sender&quot;)) %&gt;%
  rename(to = id) %&gt;%
  select(from, to, weight, amount)

#check converted edge_list then remove original
edge_list_byid</code></pre>
<p>It is not uncommon for a user to have multiple accounts which can skew network
analysis if not accounted for. To alleviate the effects of this, I used the
infomap algorithm to cluster addresses into communities. The rationale was that
most alternate accounts would closely transact with each other forming distinct
clusters. The infomap algorithm was used as it takes into account edge (trade)
direction. In order to identified key nodes in the network, addresses’
eigenvector centrality was calculated using trade frequency as a weight.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#using the node_list and edge_list_byid we can create a
#graph object
graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = node_list, edges = edge_list_byid, 
          directed = TRUE)

#cluster nodes to find communities and centralities and rewrite graph object
graph &lt;- graph %&gt;%
  activate(nodes) %&gt;%
  mutate(community = group_infomap(weights = weight)) %&gt;%
  mutate(centrality = centrality_eigen(weights = weight, directed = TRUE))</code></pre>
<p>As the DAI transaction dataset consists of over 1,500,000 transactions, addresses
(nodes) were filtered for unique transaction pairs (edges) that were in the
top 50% quantile for total transaction amount. Low value transacting nodes are
unlikely to be key to the network. As I am looking for important actors in the
network, I selected for the top 0.1% of addresses by eigenvector centrality.
The selected addresses were collapsed on their communities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filter graph by centrality to reduce size by trimming data to visualize, value amount filtered to remove low value actors
#note this also reduces community sizing as low value actors are excluded

  activate(edges) %&gt;%

and color reflected degree of connections (darker blue representing a higher

<p>Though some tentative conclusions may be made about the general network, there
are too many nodes to pick out key addresses. Only the highest valued
transaction pairs were selected to keep the map readable.</p>

visualization may be more user friendly. Before mapping in visNetwork,
community 56 data had to be transformed into a format visNetwork would accept.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>To determine if my analysis picked out key players in the the DAI ecosystem, I
checked to see if there were any exchange addresses. I expect exchanges would
be central to the network because they deal in high transaction volumes
and values. Indeed, I found 0x220bda5c8994804ac96ebe4df184d25e5c2196d4 and
0x1111111254fb6c44bAC0beD2854e76F90643097d. Both are smart contracts of 1inch,
a popular DeFi aggregator. Sushiswap’s MANA-DAI pool,
0x495F8Ef80E13e9E1e77d60d2f384bb49694823ef, was among the addresses visualized.
And finally, Uniswap’s V3 router 0xe592427a0aece92de3edee1f18e0157c05861564 was
also present.</p>
<p>The more unknown addresses provided interesting insight into the users that hold
up DAI. 0x1e3D6eAb4BCF24bcD04721caA11C478a2e59852D is one such mysterious
address. Activity on this address stopped around May 2021 but beforehand seemed
involved in high frequency trading of renBTC and wBTC. One explanation may be
that this address was an arbitrage trader transacting in BTC derived cryptos.
Their high DAI transaction values may indicate they used DAI as an arbitrage
currency. DAI allows for fee-less flash-loans (loans that are instantaneously
paid) making it very permissive for arbitrage traders.</p>
